Context Vault — Memory for AI Agents

Search your personal knowledge vault and inject context directly into ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini conversations. Save insights from any webpage with a right-click.

WHAT IT DOES
• Search your vault from the popup (Ctrl+Shift+Space / Cmd+Shift+Space)
• Inject results directly into the AI chat input box — no copy-paste
• Save selected text from any page to your vault via right-click context menu
• Works with ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini

HOW IT WORKS
Context Vault stores your knowledge as markdown files with semantic search. This extension connects to your Context Vault server (self-hosted or cloud) and lets you search and save entries without leaving the browser.

Your data stays yours — the extension only communicates with the server URL you configure. No analytics, no tracking, no third-party telemetry.

SETUP
1. Install Context Vault (npm install -g context-vault) or sign up at context-vault.com
2. Install this extension
3. Click the extension icon and enter your server URL + API key
4. Start searching and saving

FEATURES
• Popup search with keyboard shortcut
• One-click inject into AI chat interfaces
• Right-click "Save to Vault" context menu
• Connection status indicator
• Works with local and hosted Context Vault servers

PRIVACY
This extension stores only your server URL, API key, and temporary rate-limit metadata. No browsing history is collected. No data is sent anywhere except your configured server.
